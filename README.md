# TestProject
This is a demo to show how 2D line renderer can be used to create custom shapes in 3D.
In the current state of the project when mouse is clicked in game view and dragged it will place a 3D prefab asset at the position where line renderer is drawing.
The assets placed are not the best and can be made better with using a better shape. It is a scale 1 cube right now.
